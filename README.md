# The Problem
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.  Moreover, there is only one of each item (you can't put the same item in the bag more than once) and the weight and value of each item are non-negetive integers.
